    "Often you will not feed the data directly into your machine learning algorithm. Instead you will find that you can refine parts of the data before training. Many times the machine learning algorithm will reward you with increased performance. You will even find that a simple algorithm with refined data generally outperforms a very sophisticated algorithm with raw data. This part of the machine learning workflow is called feature engineering, and is most of the time a very exciting and rewarding challenge\n",
