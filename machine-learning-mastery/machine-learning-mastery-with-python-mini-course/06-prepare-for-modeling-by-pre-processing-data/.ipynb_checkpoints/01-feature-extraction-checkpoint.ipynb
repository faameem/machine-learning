    "- [**Feature selection**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection) is a machine learning technique applied on the features extracted. It is used for feature selection/dimensionality reduction on sample sets, either to improve estimatorsâ€™ accuracy scores or to boost their performance on very high-dimensional datasets.\n"
